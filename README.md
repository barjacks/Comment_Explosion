# Comment_Explosion

A Twitter Bot that grabs the comments displayed on the frontpages of leading Swiss news sites, makes a list of them all, and has the highly sophisticated robot **com_expl** tweet out the most commented piece [here](https://twitter.com/com_expl) with the average of comments per article at exactly 0800, 1200, 1700 and 2100 CET.

Sites that are currently considered:

* [20 Minuten](http://www.20min.ch)
* [Tages-Anzeiger](http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch)
* [Watson] (http://www.watson.ch)
* [Blick] (http://www.blick.ch)
